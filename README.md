# myFlix-client
The client-side component of this application is using REACT. A single-page, responsive app that has rich interactions, routing, a refined user experience, and finally several interface views. This app supports the existing server-side API by ensuring user requests and providing the response from the server-side via a number of different interface views.

The main purpose of this app is to show how I created the frontend of a fullstack application using REACT.
